NAME

    Bot::Training - Plain text training material for bots like Hailo and
    AI::MegaHAL

SYNOPSIS

        use Bot::Training;
        use File::Slurp qw< slurp >;
    
        my $bt = Bot::Training->new;
    
        # Plugins I know about. Install Task::Bot::Training for more:
        my @plugins = $bt->plugins
    
        # Get the plugin object of a .trn file (which is just a plain text
        # file). These all work just as well:
        my $hal = $bt->file('megahal');
        my $hal = $bt->file('MegaHAL');
        my $hal = $bt->file('Bot::Training::MegaHAL');
    
        # Get all lines in the file with File::Slurp:
        my @test = split /\n/, slurp($hal->file);

DESCRIPTION

    Markov bots like Hailo and AI::MegaHAL are fun. But to get them working
    you either need to train them on existing training material or make
    your own.

    This module provides a pluggable way to install already existing
    training files via the CPAN. It also comes with a command-line
    interface called bot-training.
